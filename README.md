# midi-dystrophin-af3
***In silico* structural prediction for the generation of novel performant Midi-dystrophins based on intein-mediated dual AAV approach**

The notebooks to reproduce the figure in the [manuscript](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0395/v1) "*In silico* structural prediction for the generation of novel performant Midi-dystrophins based on intein-mediated dual AAV approach". The AlphaFold3 prediction of multiple mididys constructs were done using the [AlphaFold Server](https://alphafoldserver.com/about) and can be found in the [af3_prediction folder](./af3_prediction). The sequences used for prediction can be found in the [aa_seq folder](./aa_seq)
